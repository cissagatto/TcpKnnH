\title{Build and Test Hybrid Partitions with Cross-Validation}
\usage{
maf1.test.build(parameters)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{A list containing configuration settings such as dataset
paths, number of folds, and preprocessing utilities.}
}
\value{
The function does not return a value but generates processed datasets,
prediction results, and stores output files in structured directories.
}
\description{
This function processes training, validation, and test datasets for multiple
cross-validation folds, applies different machine learning techniques for
partitioning, and evaluates model performance.
}
\details{
The function executes in parallel for each cross-validation fold, performing
the following steps:
\itemize{
\item Loads training, validation, and test datasets.
\item Merges training and validation datasets.
\item Reads sparsification details from report files.
\item Iterates over different k-NN values to determine the best partition.
\item Extracts relevant training and test subsets for each partition group.
\item Converts CSV files to ARFF format for compatibility with Java-based tools.
\item Configures and executes the CLUS decision tree algorithm.
\item Stores prediction results (\code{y_true.csv} and \code{y_predict.csv}).
\item Deletes temporary files to maintain storage efficiency.
}
