\title{Gather and Aggregate Evaluation Metrics from Multiple Folds}
\usage{
maf1.val.gather.evaluated(parameters)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{A list containing the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{Number.Folds} (integer): Number of cross-validation folds.
\item \code{FolderPartition} (string): Path to the partition directory.
\item \code{id_part} (integer or string): Identifier for the partition being evaluated.
}}
}
\value{
No explicit return value. The function saves aggregated evaluation
metrics in CSV files within the partition directory.
}
\description{
This function collects, processes, and aggregates evaluation metrics
from multiple cross-validation folds for a multilabel classification experiment.
}
\details{
The function iterates through each cross-validation fold:
\itemize{
\item Reads the evaluation metrics from \verb{Split-<f>-Evaluated.csv}.
\item Organizes and merges evaluation results across all folds.
\item Saves a consolidated CSV file with all evaluation metrics.
\item Computes and saves the mean of each metric across the folds.
\item Deletes temporary evaluation files after processing.
}

parameters <- list(
  Number.Folds = 10,
  FolderPartition = "/path/to/partition",
  id_part = 1
