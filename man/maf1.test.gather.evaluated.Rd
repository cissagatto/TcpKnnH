\title{Gather Evaluation Results for Multi-Label Classification}
\usage{
maf1.test.gather.evaluated(parameters)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{A list containing configuration settings, including folder
paths, number of folds, and reporting details.}
}
\value{
The function does not return a value but generates summary evaluation
files (\code{Evaluated-Fold-X.csv}) in the respective test partition directories.
}
\description{
This function collects evaluation results from multiple folds and KNN
partitions, consolidating them into structured CSV files.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\itemize{
\item Iterates through each cross-validation fold.
\item Loads evaluation results (\code{Split-X-knn-Y-Evaluated.csv}).
\item Aggregates performance metrics for different KNN partitions.
\item Saves consolidated results per fold.
\item Deletes temporary evaluation files after processing.
}
