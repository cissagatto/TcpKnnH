\title{Process and Save kNN-Based Partitioning Methods}
\usage{
silho.choosed(parameters)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{A list containing the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{Dataset.Info$Labels} (integer): Total number of labels in the dataset.
\item \code{Folders$folderReports} (string): Path to the reports directory.
\item \code{Folders$folderPartitions} (string): Path to the partitions directory.
\item \code{Number.Folds} (integer): Number of cross-validation folds.
}}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{all.partitions.choosed}: Data frame with all chosen partitions.
\item \code{all.methods.choosed}: Data frame with all selected kNN methods.
\item \code{all.eb.partitions}: Data frame with "eb" partitioning method results.
\item \code{all.fg.partitions}: Data frame with "fg" partitioning method results.
\item \code{all.wt.partitions}: Data frame with "wt" partitioning method results.
\item \code{sparcification}: Data frame summarizing the number of methods per fold.
\item \code{all.partitions}: Data frame of all possible partitions and groups.
\item \code{all.hybrid.partitions}: Data frame of hybrid partitions.
}
}
\description{
This function processes multiple folds of kNN-based partitions, extracts
partitioning results for different methods (eb, fg, wt), and saves them
into CSV files for further analysis.
}
\details{
The function performs the following operations:
\itemize{
\item Generates a list of partitions and groups.
\item Iterates over each fold to read kNN partitioning results.
\item Reads different partitioning method outputs (\code{eb}, \code{fg}, \code{wt}).
\item Stores and merges results into consolidated data frames.
\item Saves outputs as CSV files in the reports directory.
