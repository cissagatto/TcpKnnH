\title{Organize Evaluation Results for Multi-Label Classification}
\usage{
maf1.test.organize.evaluation(parameters)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{A list containing configuration settings, including folder
paths, number of folds, and reporting details.}
}
\value{
The function does not return a value but generates structured CSV
files summarizing the evaluation results across folds and KNN settings.
}
\description{
This function aggregates evaluation results from multiple folds and KNN
partitions, computing summary statistics (mean, median, and standard
deviation) across 10 folds.
}
\details{
The function follows these steps:
\itemize{
\item Initializes data structures for storing evaluation results.
\item Iterates through each cross-validation fold to read evaluation files.
\item Aggregates performance metrics for each KNN partition.
\item Computes mean, median, and standard deviation for each metric.
\item Saves the summarized results in CSV format (\verb{Evaluated-10Folds-Knn-X.csv},
\verb{Mean-10Folds-Knn-X.csv}, \verb{Median-10Folds-Knn-X.csv}, \verb{SD-10Folds-Knn-X.csv}).
\item Deletes temporary evaluation files after processing.
}
